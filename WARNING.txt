This script uses commands as “eval” and “adb shell” in conjunction with file names. This lets to making this script very unsafe, since it can let to code injection.

Even though, I have tried to escaped or block all unsafe characters, I’m afraid I’m not an expert to prevent all possible vulnerabilities.

I don’t think that injecting code on files names is very common, but you never can be sure. Also, you might inject something your self by mistake.

All I’m saying is, be careful on your file names. And also, use this code at your own risk.

I might have avoided using “eval” but I don’t think “adb shell” could had been.

I’m open to suggestions. Thank you.
